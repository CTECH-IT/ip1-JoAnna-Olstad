Description: The game I am going to make is Tic Tac Toe. 

Rules: 
The goal of the game is to be the first person to get 3 in a row.
One person is X and the other person is O.
Take turns placing X’s or O’s in the squares. 
The game is over when one person gets 3 in a row or all 9 squares are filled
If all 9 squares are filled and noone has 3 in a row then it is a tie
You cannot put a piece on top of another piece

Design Goals: 
Make the X’s red and the O’s blue
Make the background a red/white/blue gradient
Make a pop up that says which player won
