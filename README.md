Description: The game I am going to make is Tic Tac Toe. 

Game: Tic Tac Toe


Game Rules: 

The goal of the game is to be the first person to get 3 in a row. It can be vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 
One person is X and the other person is O.
Take turns placing X’s or O’s in the squares. 
The game is over when one person gets 3 in a row or all 9 squares are filled. 
If all 9 squares are filled and noone has 3 in a row then it is a tie. 
You cannot put a piece on top of another piece. 


Quantifiable Design Goals: 

Make the favicon a tic tac toe board. 
Make the X’s red and the O’s blue. 
Make the tiles and the text black. 
Make the background a red and blue gradient. 
Make a popup that tells you which player won the game. 
Make a reset game button.
